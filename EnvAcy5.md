Description to be added here


Why this case study? 
Underway (MKS management): 10 m, 20 m, 40 m and 80 m for a comparision between ACC-CPU/GPU, FV1-CPU/GPU, DG2-CPU/GPU. Coarse-DG2 does not need GPU! Better velocity prediction. Compare floodplains with metrics H, F and C at t = 3 hours. Downscaling capability.
