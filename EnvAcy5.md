### Valley flooding following a dam failure

This test case is standard to study and compare the capabilities of 2D hydrodynamic solvers for modelling rapidly-propagating flow over a non-smooth valley ([Ayog et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169420313858); [Shaw et al. 2021](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-340/)). The 10 m x 10 m resolution DEM and the inflow hydrograph are available from the UK Environment Agency. Coarser resolution DEMs can be produced via QGIS.

Flooding occurs from a 260-m wide opening located inside the valley from the southwest side (left part in the figure) where the inflow hydrograph is applied (right part in the figure). This hydrograph has a strong inflow peak occurring over a short duration to propagate throughout the valley until after 30 hours when the water has ponded near the closed boundary at the eastern edge of the domain. 

_To set up this simulation on LISFLOOD-FP8.0, a point source boundary condition is needed … MKS … What is this? What the user specificies? File names? The number of points is dependent on the resolution of the grid … right MKS? To be continued_ (unfinished)


_To quantitatively compare and analyse floodplain extents, a post-processing toolkit is available… _ (unfinished)
