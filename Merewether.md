### Merewether urban flooding
This test case is based on a physical model constructed to simulate the overland flow path in an urban area with building including pieres in Merewether, Newcastle, Australia, during the June 2007 flooding event [(Smith et al. 2017)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15715124.2016.1193510). The constructed model was 12.5 m long by 5 m wide, and was scaled (30:1 horizontal, 9:1 vertical) to the prototype shown in the figure below.

The model DEM, water level and velocity data were recorded relative to an arbitrary datum (at model scale) and were transformed to prototype scale using known survey points and the Froude scaling relationships. These data files are available for download through the [Water Research Laboratory of University of New South Wales Australia Data Warehouse website](http://datawarehouse.wrl.unsw.edu.au/newcastlefloodmodel/). An overview of the DEM including the location of buildings and of the inflow (bottom right corner) are shown in the figure below. The physical model experiments were run at steady state with a constant flow rate of 19.7 cubic meters per second.
