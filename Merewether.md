Description of the test case + 

- DG2 initial condition and topography 
- Fine resolution modelling (0.175m ==> millions of cells)
- Benefit of GPU solvers 
- Velocitiy prediction and small eddy capturing (Water levels + velocities)
- Bug free codes for DG2/FV1 CPU and GPU 
- Other metrics like relevance index.
