Why this case study? Should be different than EA5.  
Underway (MKS management): 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 40 m for a comparision between ACC-CPU/GPU, FV1-CPU/GPU, DG2-CPU/GPU. Coarse-DG2 does not need GPU! Better velocity prediction. Compare floodplains with metrics H, F and C at t = 3 hours. Downscaling capability.
