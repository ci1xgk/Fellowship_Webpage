#### Carlistle 2005, urban flooding

This test case is aimed to simulate urban flooding over a real-world study area, where the flooding occurs from three sources. It is useful to understand how to handle multiple point source inflow boundary conditions in LISFLOOD. The study area is about 14.5 square kilometers and includes the urban area of Carlisle, a city in northern England with a population of 70,000 that was heavily hit by flooding in January 2005 [(Horritt et al. 2010)](https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/pdf/10.1680/wama.2010.163.6.273). The flooding hydrodynamics was driven by three river streams: Eden, River Petteril and River Caldew, located within the study area. The figure below shows the study area and the three locations, *Upstream 1*, *Upstream 2* and *Upstream 3*, for each of the river streams from where floodwater flow occured.

To apply LISFLOOD to simulate the 2005 flooding event, the DEM data and the three upstream inflow boundary conditions are required. A 5 m x 5 m resolution DEM data, named `carlisle-5m.dem`, was obtained from the School of Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol. It was created by further processing the LiDAR DEM provided by the UK Environment Agency (EA) by removing the noises and obstacles (e.g. trees and bridges). 

Floodwater flow breached from the three openings, *Upstream 1*, *Upstream 2* and *Upstream 3* (marked in the figure), based on three different discharge hydrographs (in 15-minute intervals). These hydrographs are shown in figure below. They were generated through 1D flood routing from previous studies (e.g. [Neal et al., 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hyp.9572)).

To set up LISFLOOD, starting from `carlisle-5m.bci`, the discharge (inflow) hydrographs have to be specified as point sources (inflow boundary conditions), while western edge of the study area is set to allow free outflow to allow the water to exit. The figure below shows an snapshot of `carlisle-5m.bci` file.

The first row include the `W` identifier for activating the west boundary as `FREE` outflow condition bewteen the locations defined by the two Y-direction coordinate listed in the second and third columns. The following rows specify a series of points sources (identifier `P`), defined as the time-varying inflow (type `QVAR`) with names `upstream1`, `upstream2`, `upstream3`. Note that these names must be consistent with the naming of the time series specified in the `.bdy`, explained below. 

For the 5 m x 5 m resolution DEM data, 11 cells span the `upstream1` time series to cover the width of River Eden from point `(x,y) = (342662, 557552)` to `(x,y) = (342707, 557503)`, 6 cells span the `upstream2` time series to cover the width of River Petteril from point `(x,y) = (341352, 554702)` to `(x,y) = (341377, 554702)`, and 6 cells span the `upstream3` time series to cover the width of River Caldew from point `(x,y) = (339937, 554702)` to `(x,y) = (339962, 554702)`. For a DEM data files with a finer or coarser resolution, different number must be manually specified by investigating these positision via QGIS.  

The time time-varying inflow, `upstream1`, `upstream2` and `upstream3`, specified in the `carlisle-5m.bci` file, should be provided in a time series file, named `carlisle.bdy` file. The layout of the `carlisle.bdy` file is similar to the one explained for [*"Valley flooding"*](/EnvAcy5.md) test case. However, for this test case, the same `.bdy` file has to include the three time series listed one after after antoher. For the first time series, its name, `upstream1`, have to be specified followed by the number of time intervals and the lists of the time-varying inflow discharge alongside its time of occurence. The second time series, with the name `upstream2`, and then the third time series, with the name `upstream3`, can be handled in a similar way. 


To quantitatively compare and analyse floodplain extents, a post-processing toolkit is available in the post-processing directory. The toolkit generates several metrics based on comparing the flood extent generated by the LISFLOOD-FP simulation to a reference flood extent, evaluating LISFLOOD's overall performance in predicting the flood extent. The rationale behind the matrics and how to use the toolkit for Carlistle 2005 urban flooding test case is described [here](/metrics.md)
