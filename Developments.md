### Developments
Development, testing and validatin of new modelling techniques and integrated simulators have been ongoing during the SEAMLESS-WAVE project. These include the following: 

[Agent-based food-pedestrian simulator](./Flood_Human_ABM.md)

[Efficient uncertainty propagation approaches](./Uncertainty_Propagation.md)

[Second-order discontinous Galerkin (DG2) flood model](./Robust_DG2.md)

[Wavelet-based solvers that self-automate grid-resolution size](./MuliWave_Flood_models.md)
