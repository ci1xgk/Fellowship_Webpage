### Developments
Development, testing and validatin of new modelling techniques and integrated simulators have been ongoing during the SEAMLESS-WAVE project. These include the following: 

[Modelling human-flood response dynamics](./Flood_Human_ABM.md)

[Robust and efficient second-order discontinous Galerkin (DG2) flood model ](./Robust_DG.md)

[Efficient and accurate flood simulators with wavelet adaptivity](./MuliWave_Flood_models.md)

[Efficient uncertainty quantification for probabilistic flood simulations](./Uncertainty_Propagation.md)
