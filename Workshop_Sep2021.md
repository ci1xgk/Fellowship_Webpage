### The ‘Flood modelling & forecasting challenges in industry’ workshop
The workshop, held on 16/09/2021, was part of the EPSRC-funded project SEAMLESS-WAVE and was supported by [TWENTY65](https://www.twenty65.ac.uk/). It brought together practitioners and scholars, in an attempt to identify and discuss timely issues in operational-scale flood modelling, forecasting and management. The workshop aimed to increase our understanding of industrial and practical needs that require further addressing in academic research. The focus was on the themes: 

- Overview of the flooding challenges 
- Improved modelling and integrative strategies 
- Consideration to assess and improve resilience 

The workshop was facilitated by a series of invited talks by experts on from academia, industry and UK orginisations. The title of talks and speakers are listed the [agenda]() (see the appendix). 
A direct outcome of the workshop was an online document capturing the ideas formed during a workshop’s breakout session. This document will then be used as a starting point to develop a multi-authored contribution for publication, while seeking the feedback from the workshop’s speakers.

The themes of the workshop are expected to interest researchers focused on flood model development, testing, application and validation for real-world applications, as well as those interested in flood resilience quantification at urban-scale.
