## The ‘Flood modelling & forecasting challenges in industry’ workshop
### Date:	September 16, 2021
### Location:	United Kingdom
### Facilitators:	Georges Kesserwani, Vanessa Speight, Mahya Hajihassanpour, Elizabeth K Court 

The workshop was part of the EPSRC-funded project SEAMLESS-WAVE and supported by [TWENTY65](https://www.twenty65.ac.uk/). It brought together practitioners and scholars, in an attempt to identify and discuss timely issues in operational-scale flood modelling, forecasting and management. The workshop aimed to increase our understanding of industrial and practical needs that require further addressing in academic research. The focus was on the themes: 

- Overview of flooding challenges
- Modelling 
- Resilience

The workshop was facilitated by a series of invited talks by experts from academia, industry and UK organisations. Title of the talks and speakers' information are listed in the [agenda]() (see the appendix). During the lunch break, there was a virtual networking event on [Gather Town]() allowing participants to meet each other online.  

At the end of the workshop, participates were directed into [Miro]()'s whiteboards letting them enter their thoughts, comments and ideas. The result of this brainstorm can be seen hereunder:   

A direct outcome of the workshop is an online [post-workshop report]() written based on compiling and analysing the participants' inputs. This [document]() can be used as a starting point to develop a multi-authored contribution for publication.
