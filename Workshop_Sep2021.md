### Date:	September 16, 2021
### Location:	United Kingdom

The workshop held on 16/09/2021, and it was part of the EPSRC-funded project SEAMLESS-WAVE and was supported by [TWENTY65](https://www.twenty65.ac.uk/). It brought together practitioners and scholars, in an attempt to identify and discuss timely issues in operational-scale flood modelling, forecasting and management. The workshop aimed to increase our understanding of industrial and practical needs that require further addressing in academic research. The focus was on the themes: 

- Overview of the flooding challenges 
- Improved modelling and integrative strategies 
- Consideration to assess and improve resilience 

The workshop was facilitated by a series of invited talks by experts on from academia, industry and UK orginisations. Title of the talks and speakers information are listed the [agenda]() (see the appendix). During the lunch break, there was a virtual networking event on Gather allowing participants to meet each other online.  

At the end of the workshop, participates were directed into Miro's whitebaords letting them to enter their thoughts, comments and ideas. The result of this brainstorm can be seen hereunder:   

A direct outcome of the workshop is an online [document]() capturing these ideas formed during the workshop’s breakout session. This [document]() can be used as a starting point to develop a multi-authored contribution for publication, while seeking the feedback from the workshop’s speakers.
