### The ‘Flood modelling & forecasting challenges in industry’ workshop
The workshop was part of the EPSRC-funded project SEAMLESS-WAVE and was supported by [TWENTY65](https://www.twenty65.ac.uk/) and the [IAHR](https://www.iahr.org/). It brought together practitioners and scholars in the field, aiming to identify and discuss timely issues in operational-scale flood modelling and forecasting. The focus was on the themes:

- improving operational-scale flood mapping and forecasting, and 
- flood resilience metric production including human response components

The workshop was facilitated by a series of invited talks by experts on subjects, which include hydraulic modelling and engineering, uncertainty quantification, flood-incident emergency response and management, and resilient engineering.

A direct outcome of the workshop was an online document capturing the ideas formed during a workshop’s breakout session. This document will then be used as a starting point to develop a multi-authored contribution for publication, while seeking the feedback from the workshop’s speakers.

The themes of the workshop are expected to interest researchers focused on flood model development, testing, application and validation for real-world applications, as well as those interested in flood resilience quantification at urban-scale.
