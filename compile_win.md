#### Compiling on Windows

To compile LISFLOOD-FP on Windows, [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) are required. By default, CMake is installed as part of the **Desktop development with C++** workloads, in the process of installing Visual studio. 

To compile the code either of MSVC (the default C++ compiler of Visual Studio) or [Intel C++ compilers](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html) can be used.
