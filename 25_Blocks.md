As the localisation procedure for slope limiting with DG2 doubles its runtime cost, and we recommend applying DG2 without local slope limiting (DG2-NL) for the majority of flood modelling applications involving gradually varied flows over rough terrain [(Ayog et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169420313858). 

The variant of the DG2 with local limiting (DG2-LL) comes in handy when simulating one or multiple shock waves over smooth terrain including sharp obstacles, as we demonstrate in the following case study of a complex dam-break wave interacting with an idealised urban district [(Soares-Frazao and Zech 2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3826/jhr.2008.3164).
