As the localisation procedure for slope limiting with DG2 doubles its runtime cost, we recommend applying DG2 without local slope limiting (DG2-NL) for flood modelling applications with smooth to gradual flows over terrain with medium to high roughness, Manning coefficient > 0.02 [(Ayog et al. 2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169420313858). 


The variant of the DG2 with local limiting (DG2-LL) comes in handy for simulation problems involving one or multiple shock-wave propagation over a smooth terrain surface and complex interaction with sharp obstacles. The relevance of choosing DG2-LL is demonstrated for the *"Complex dam-break wave interacting with an idealised urban district" test case* reported in [Soares-Frazao and Zech (2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3826/jhr.2008.3164). Based on the dimensions reported in this paper, a DEM file was build, using QGIS, at a resolution of 0.2 m x 0.2 m.


The study area is an experimental flume with smooth surface (Manning coefficient of 0.01) that is shown in the upper panel of the figure below. It includes twenty-five 0.3 m Ã— 0.3 m square blocks placed with a gap of 0.1 m between each block. The wall barrier with a gate initially separates a water depth of 0.4 m to a water depth 0.011 m. When the gate is rapidly opened, a dam-break wave is formed and flows swiftly to collide with the blocks.

Both the DEM file and the initially wet dam-break condition were pre-processed to form DG2-related initial conditions (details in case study "1. Preparing initial DG2 conditions"). DG2-NL and DG2-LL simulations were run up to 10 s on a mesh with a grid size of 0.02 m. An alternative simulation was run using the well-established MUSCL-FV2 solver, widely used by many research groups and for industrial-scale modelling applications, e.g. [TUFLOW-HPC](https://wiki.tuflow.com/index.php?title=HPC_Introduction).  


The simulated spatial profiles of the water depth and velocity are extracted along the centreline y = 0.2 m (red line in the figure, upper panel) at two output times, 5 s and 6 s, shown in the middle and bottom panel of the figure, respectively. The water depth profiles are located on the left part of the figure, whereas the right side shows the velocity profiles.  


DG2-LL shows a closer alignment with the profiles produced by the MUSCL-FV2 solver, both of which showing a good agreement with all the observed data. The DG2-NL, though in good agreement with some of the observed data, leads to noisy profiles that in many instances locally diverge from the profiles produced by DG2-LL and MUSCL-FV2.
