### Running the code, outputs and visualization

To run the simulations, user must follow the instructions in section [*"Running LISFLOOD"*](). As an example for running the Merewether test case on windows, user needs to copy paste the LISFLOOD executable file, namely `lisflood.exe`, to the same folder as the input files. Figure below shows the working directory.

By clicking on the *location bar* of Windows Explorer, then entering `cmd` and press *Enter* key, the *Command Prompt Window* will be opened in the folder, as figure below.
