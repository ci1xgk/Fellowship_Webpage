### Running the code, outputs and visualization

To run the simulations, user must follow the instructions in section [*"Running LISFLOOD"*](). As an example for running the Merewether test case on windows, user needs to copy paste the LISFLOOD executable file, namely `lisflood.exe`, to the same folder as the input files. Figure below shows the working directory.
