#### Downscaling coarse-resolution DG2 flood maps

As opposed to piecewise-constant data representation used in first order methods like, FV1, the DG2 solver represents data as piecewise-planar per element defined by three coefficients: an average-coefficient and two slope-coefficients in X and Y directions ([Shaw et al. 2021](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-340/)). This can be laveraged to increase the resolution of the flood maps generated by the DG2 solver.
