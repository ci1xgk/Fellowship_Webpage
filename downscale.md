#### Downscaling coarse-resolution DG2 flood maps

As opposed to piecewise-constant data representation used in first order methods like, FV1, the DG2 solver represents data as piecewise-planar per element defined by three coefficients: an average-coefficient and two slope-coefficients in X and Y directions ([Shaw et al. 2021](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-340/)). This can be laveraged to increase the resolution of the flood maps generated by the DG2 solver. This process is here called **downscaling**.

The left panel in the figure below, shows an schematic view of the planar represantion of the DG2-generated data (like water depth or water surface elevation) over a coarse cell. If the cell is devided into four subcells, using this planar representation, it is possible to evaluate the data on the centers of each 4 subcells. This
