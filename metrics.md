#### Performance metrics for flood extent prediction 

Different metrics are used to evaluated different aspects of a flood model's performance, compared to reference or benchmark data [(Hoch and Trigg, 2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf3d3). For example, when the focus of comparison is the surface water elevation at a certain location, the RMSE (root-mean-square error) or the bias (mean difference between water levels) is usually used to compare water elevations predicted by the model (or **model data**) to in-situ water elevation measurments (or **benchmark data**). 

To validate the performance of a flood model in predicting the flood extent, three metrics are commonly used within the hydraulic modeling community, namely Hit Rate (H), False Alarm Ratio (F), and Critical Success Index (C) [(Wing et al. 2017)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017WR020917). In the process of comuting these metrics, model data is the flood extent predicted by the model, while benchmark data refers to either surveyed extent of the flooding event or the flood extent from a reference flood modeling simulation.  

These metrics compare the benchmark data cells _vs._ model data cells one by one, in a binary (wet or dry) manner, and sum up them as four states shown in the table and schematic figure below.  

   |  | **Wet in Benchmark Data (B1)** | **Dry in Benchmark Data (B0)** |
   | :---         | :---      | :--- |
   | **Wet in Model Data (M1)**   | M1B1      | M1B0    |
   | **Dry in Model Data (M0)**   | M0B1      | M0B0    |

M1B1 denotes the total number of cells that are wet in both of the benchmark and model data, M0B0 denotes the total number of cells that are dry in both of the benchmark and model data, M1B0 denotes the total number of cells that are wet in the model data but dry in the benchmark data, and M0B1 denotes the total number of cells that are dry in the model data but wet in the benchmark data. 


The **Hit Rate (H)** is a simple measure that assess the proportion of wet benchmark data cells that was also predicted as wet by the model:

````
H = M1B1 / (M1B1 + M0B1)
````

H ranges from 0 (none of the wet benchmark data cells are wet in the model data) to 1 (all wet benchmark data cells are wet in the model data). Since this metric only considers the area with wet benchmark data cells, it only examines the modelâ€™s tendency toward underprediction of the flood extent.

The **False Alarm Ratio (F)** indicates the proportion of the wet model data cells that are not wet in the benchmark data:

````
F = M1B0 / (M1B0 + M1B1)
````

This metric gives an idea of whether the model has the tendency to overpredict the flood extent. In this sense, a cell that is wet in model data but dry in benchmark data is regarded as *false alarm*. Therefore, F can range from 0 (none of the model data cells are false alarms) to 1 (all of the model data cells are false alarms). 

The **Critical Success Index (C)** is a composite measure, which combines H and F and allows for simpler overall comparison of extent prediction performance:

````
C = M1B1 / (M1B1 + M0B1 + M1B0)
````

where scores range from 0, showing no match between benchmark and model data, to 1 , which shows the perfect match between benchmark and model data.

#### Python script to compute the metrics

A simple Python script, named `metrics.py` is included in the post-processing directory, to compute these metrics. The script requires GDAL package for reading the data. The process of computing the metrics is here described as an example for the Carlistle 2005 urban flooding test case.

To run the script, two ASCII rastar files with the same resolution and extent, one for benchmark data and the other for the model data is required. The model data is the Maximum water depth (`.max`) file (recall [Running the code, outputs and visualisation](/Merewether3.md)) resulted from running LISFLOOD-FP with the ACC solver. This file is generated at the end of simulation, with the name `carlisle-5m.max`. For benchmark data, eventhough it is possible to use surveyed extent data, but in this example the LISFLOOD-FP simulation using the FV1 solver is used. Therefore, the generated Maximum water depth file (named `carlisle-5m.max` as well) from the FV1 simulation, is used as the benchmark data. Since both files are generated with the same name, they are renamed to `carlisle-5m-acc.max` for the ACC and `carlisle-5m-fv1.max` for the FV1 solvers. Figure below shows the maps of model and benchmark data.

To run the script, the name of these two files must be entered at lines 138~140 of the script, as shown below:

````
model_fn = "carlisle-5m-acc.max" 
bench_fn = "carlisle-5m-fv1.max" 
````
After saving the file, it runs with command:

````
python metrics.py
````

and shows the metrics on the screen:

````
Hit rate: 0.905324
False Alarm rate: 0.026091
Critical success index: 0.883887
````

along with a so-called **contingency map** [(Hoch et al., 2017)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/3913/2017/) as shown in figure below. The contingency map, ilustrates the flood extent of both model and benchmark data. In the map, the green area is the portion of the floodplain that is flooded both in model and benchmark data (M1B1), the red area is only flooded in the benchmark data (M0B1) and the blue area is only flooded in the model data (M1B0).

The combination of the metrics and the contingency map provide a measure on how much and in which areas the benchmark and model data differ or agree in their flood extents. In this example, the hit rate of 0.90 indicates that 90% of extent flooded in the benchmark is also flooded by the model, and only 10% of the benchmark flood extent is underpredicted by the model. This is also reflected in the contingency map, i.e. all the green area is correctly flooded by the model while the red area is underpredicted.   

On the other hand, the false alarm ratio of 0.02 shows that only in 2% of the model flood extent, overprediction by the model is occured. These overpredicted areas are shown in blue on the contingency map. 

Finally, as a combined criteria, the critical success index of 0.88 shows that 88% of the whole flooded area (i.e. the union of the model and benchamrk flood extent) is correctly flooded by the model. *to finish*
