#### Performance metrics

The performance measures used are spatial variants of the commonly employed Hit Rate, False Alarm Ratio, and Critical Success Index, the latter of which is often referred to within the hydraulic modeling community as the ‘‘Fit’’ statistic [Alfieri et al., 2013; Aronica et al., 2002; Bates and De Roo, 2000; Fewtrell et al., 2008;
Werner et al., 2005]. A simple error bias metric is also used. The Hit Rate (H), sometimes referred to as the probability of detection, is a simple measure that indicates how well the model replicates the benchmark data without penalizing for overprediction:

You can use $$\LaTeX$$ to typeset formulas. A formula can be displayed inline, e.g. $$e=mc^2$$, or as a block:
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$
