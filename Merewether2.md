### Preparing the input data

In this section, the preparation and processing of the input data are explained as an example for the Merewether test case. The same method could be used for other test cases. 

1. [Viewing the DEM data on QGIS](Merewether2-1.md)

2. [Modifying the resolution of the DEM on QGIS](Merewether2-2.md)

3. [Preparing the initial conditions files for ACC/FV1 on QGIS](Merewether2-3.md)

4. [Preparing the DG2-related DEM files using `generateDG2DEM` toolkit](Merewether2-4.md)
