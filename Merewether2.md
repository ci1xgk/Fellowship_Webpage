### Preparing the input data

In this section the preparation and process of the input data is explained for the Merewether test case, as an example. The same process could be used for other test cases. 

1. [Viewing the DEM data on QGIS](Merewether2-1.md)

2. [Modifying the resolution of the DEM on QGIS](Merewether2-2.md)

3. [Preparing the initial conditions files for ACC/FV1 on QGIS](Merewether2-3.md)

4. [Preparing the DG2-related DEM files using `generateDG2DEM` toolkit](Merewether2-4.md)

5. Preparing the DG2-related Initial condition files using `generateDG2start` toolkit

6. Setting up boundary conditions
