# Input files and their format
For a typical simulation using either of ACC, FV1 or DG2 solvers, data is input to the model using following file types. Users should note that the file extensions are not mandatory, comments can only be used in the parameter file (`.par`) and all items are case sensitive. 

1. [Parameter file (`.par`)](/Merewether1-1.md) 

2. [Boundary condition type file (`.bci`)](/Merewether1-2.md)

3. [Time varying boundary conditions file (`.bdy`)](/Merewether1-3.md)

4. [Digital Elevation Model file (`.dem`)](/Merewether1-4.md)

5. [Stage output data file (`.stage`)](/Merewether1-5.md)

6. [Start file â€“ water depth or elevation (`.start`)](/Merewether1-6.md)
