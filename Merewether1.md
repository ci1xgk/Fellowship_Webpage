### Input files and their format
To set up a 2D solver including ACC, FV1 or DG2, input files and parameters need to be specified. Note that: (i) the file extension names in the list below are not mandatory, (ii) comments can only be used in the parameter file (with the extension of `.par`), (iii) all file and parameter names are case sensitive. 

1. [Parameter file (`.par`)](/Merewether1-1.md) 

2. [Boundary condition type file (`.bci`)](/Merewether1-2.md)

3. [Time-varying boundary conditions file (`.bdy`)](/Merewether1-3.md)

4. [Digital Elevation Model file (`.dem`)](/Merewether1-4.md)

5. [Input file including the positions where water depth and velocity histories are to be extracted (`.stage`)](/Merewether1-5.md)

6. [Start file â€“ water depth (or elevation) and discharges (`.start`, `.start.Qx`, `.start.Qy`)](/Merewether1-6.md)

7. [Floodplain friction coefficient Manning's file (`.n`)](/Merewether1-7.md)

8. [Spatially- and temporarily-varying rainfall file (`.nc`)](/Merewether1-8.md)
