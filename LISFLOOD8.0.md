## LISFLOOD-FP8.2 

The LISFLOOD-FP is a raster-based hydrodynamic model originally developed by the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/hydrology/models/lisflood/). It has undergone extensive development since conception and includes a collection of numerical schemes implemented to solve a variety of mathematical approximations of the 2D shallow water equations of different complexity. 

The local inertia solver, known as the ACC solver, is widely used to simulate floods with gradually-varying, subcritical flow over sufficiently rough surfaces with Manning’s coefficient of at least 0.03. It has a version with CPU-specific optimisations and enhanced with a subgrid channel model ([Neal et al., 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR012514), [2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815217307478)). 

LISFLOOD-FP also includes second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) and first-order finite volume (FV1) solvers of the full shallow water equations for modelling a wide range of flows, including rapidly-propagating, supercritical flows, shock waves, or flows over very smooth surfaces. The DG2/FV1 solvers are parallelised for the multi-core CPU architecture, but do not integrate with the subgrid channel model nor with the CPU-specific optimisations. 

In an attempt to decrease the computational costs of running flooding simulations, the ACC, FV1 and DG2 solvers have also been accelerated using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to exploit their greater degree of parallelisation ([Shaw et al., 2021](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-340/)). 

The suitable applications for each of the aformentioned solvers of LISFLOOD-FP are summarised in the table below, along with their potential limitations.  

<!--
The LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model developed by the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/hydrology/models/lisflood/) already includes a solver with local inertia, or ‘gravity wave’ formulation, known as the ACC solver, and a solver with the diffusive wave, or ‘zero-inertia’ formulation, known as the ATS solver. The ACC solver is widely used to simulate floods with gradually-varying, subcritical flow over sufficiently rough surfaces with Manning’s coefficient of at least 0.03. It has a version with CPU-specific optimisations and enhanced with a subgrid channel model ([Neal et al., 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR012514), [2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815217307478)). Please contact [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/hydrology/models/lisflood/) for any advice related to the ACC solver.

### New DG2/FV1 solvers on multi-core CPU 
The new version, LISFLOOD-FP 8.0, includes second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) and first-order finite volume (FV1) solvers of the two-dimensional shallow water equations for modelling a wide range of flows, including rapidly-propagating, supercritical flows, shock waves, or flows over very smooth surfaces. The new DG2/FV1 solvers are purely two-dimensional and parallelised for the multi-core CPU architecture, but do not integrate with the subgrid channel model nor with the CPU-specific optimisations ([Shaw et al., 2021](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-340/)).

<!-- 
### New GPU solvers 
The new DG2/FV1 solvers are also parallelised within a new Nvidia GPU architecture and can run existing LISFLOOD-FP modelling scenarios without modification. The [user manual of LISFLOOD-FP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yk5txMWWfSqPcPOqjQh30XLSp8Sypy1M/view?usp=sharing) has been updated to further offer guidance about how to parametrise the code to run on the GPU, in particular for the DG2/FV1 solvers. Users interested in knowing more about the mathematical/computational background of the DG2/FV1 solvers and how to run them on LISFLOOD-FP are encouraged to start their readings from [Shaw et al. (2021)](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2020-340/).

   | Solver | Suitable applications | Limitations  |
   | :---         | :---      | :--- |
   | ACC   | Fluvial flooding; Pluvial flooding on catchment-scale resolutions      | Not recommended for supercritical flows, e.g., thin flows in pluvial flooding simulations at fine resolution   |
   | FV1     | Fluvial and Pluvial flooding; Dam-breaks       | Might fail in capturing small-scale transients of flows       |
   | DG2     | Fluvial flooding; Dam-breaks; tsunamis; Flows around hydraulic structures       | High computational cost for large-scale applications; Restrictive time-step for applications that involve thin flows    |


### ACC solver adapted on a static, non-uniform grid, generated by multiwavelets Galerkin projection of the DEM
The latest version of LISFLOOD-FP includes a new solver, known as the non-uniform ACC solver. The non-uniform grid is generated by the application of the multiresolution analyses (MRA) of multiwavelets (MWs) on the Galerkin projecion of the topography data of a digital elevation model (DEM). The ACC solver is adapted on this non-uniform grid without any grading across resolution levels. An overview of the technical background of the non-uniform ACC solver is avaiable in the following online [preprint](https://www.hydrology-and-earth-system-sciences.net/). An overview of the updates to the LISFLOOD-FP workflow, including the new parameters required for the non-uniform ACC solver and video tutorials for reproducing a series of real-world catchement- and urban-scale case studies, are provided in a dedicated section: [*"Using the non-uniform ACC solver"*](/ACC_NU.md). 

The rest of this page includes instructions on how to download, install and run the code of LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 for using the uniform grid DG2 and FV1 solvers. 

Guidance is provided on producing the Galerkin polynomial projection of the DEM and initial condition files (with slope-coefficients), and on post-processing the coarse Galerkin polynomial output files to downscale them into a floodplain map at finer resolutions.

The documented instructions are also covered in video tutorials and through realistic case studies.

### Case studies 
Case studies are presented to instruct users on how to set up and run the DG2/FV1/ACC solvers of LISFLOOD-FP. These studies are also useful to identify the most optimal DG2 configuration for the targeted application.


#### [1. Merewether urban flooding](./Merewether.md)
This case study [(Smith et al., 2017)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15715124.2016.1193510) is used to explain how to set up and run LISFLOOD-FP for beginners using any of the DG2, FV1 and ACC two-dimensional hydrodynamic solvers on the CPU or the GPU.  


#### [2. Dam-break wave over an urban area](./25_Blocks.md) 
This case study [(Soares-Frazao and Zech, 2008)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3826/jhr.2008.3164) is aimed to demonstrate when local slope limiting with DG2 should be applied. 


#### [3. Valley flooding following a dam failure](./EnvAcy5.md)  
This case study [(Néelz and Pender, 2013)](https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/engagement/bostonbarriertwao/results/appendix-6---neelz--s.---pender--g.--2013--benchmarking-the-latest-generation-of-2d-hydraulic-modelling-packages.-bristol_environment-agency.pdf) is aimed to demonstrate how to handle an inflow boundary condition located inside the computational area, at source point(s).


#### [4. Carlisle 2005 urban flooding](./Carlistle_flooding.md)
This case study [(Horritt et al., 2010)](https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/pdf/10.1680/wama.2010.163.6.273) is particularly aimed to demonstrate how to handle multiple inflow boundary conditions from different source point(s). It is also used to demonstrate a new postprocessing toolkit for producing metrics to evaluate the floodplain extent predictions when comparing the simulation outcomes of two different hydrodynamic solvers.


#### [5. Eden 2015 fluvial flooding](./Desmond_Eden2015.md)  
This case study [(Xia et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030917081930243X) involves overland flow driven by spatially- and temporally-varying rainfall data over a 2500 kilometre square catchment. It is aimed to demonstrate how to use spatially-varying Manning coefficients provided in an input file, along with the new rain-on-grid option of LISFLOOD-FP 8.0. It is also used to demonstrate a new postprocessing toolkit for downscaling coarse-resolution planar DG2 flood maps.
