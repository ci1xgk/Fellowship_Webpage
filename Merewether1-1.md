#### Parameter file (`.par`)

This is the starting file for setting up and running any simulation. Inside this file, parameters are entered including the names and location of files of relevance for the case study under condideration. While putting entries or items in the `.par` file, the following rules apply:  

   * Only the items listed in [LISFLOOD user manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yk5txMWWfSqPcPOqjQh30XLSp8Sypy1M/view) should be entered. Any other item will be ignored. 
   
   * There should only be one item per line. Items can be entered in no particualr order. To comment out a line add a `#` in the first character space.

   * If an expected _item name_ does not appear, the model resorts to the default value specified without generating an error message.
   
To run the 2D ACC, FV1 and DG2 floodplain solvers, the following list of items need to be specified in the `.par` file.

For the DG2 solver, as it relies on piecewise-planar representation based on average coefficients and two slope coefficients along the X and Y directions, three seperate files must be provided for each of the DEM and initial condition start files: one file containing the average-coefficient values (in ARC ascii raster format) and two extra files containing the slope-coefficient values in X and Y directions (each in ARC ascii raster format). The user can generate these files manually, from the raw DEM file and a given initial condition(s), by following instructions in [*"Preparing the DG2-related DEM files using generateDG2DEM toolkit"*](/Merewether2-4.md) and [*"Preparing the DG2-related Initial condition files using generateDG2start toolkit"*](/Merewether2-5.md). 

In the `.par` file, however, **only** the file containing the average-coefficient values needs to be specified (i.e. by setting the _item names_ `DEMfile`, `startfile` or `startelev`); and, by doing so, the two extra files including the slope-coefficient values will be read automatically.
