#### Eden 2015, fluvial flooding

This test case aims to simulate fluvial flooding resulted from rainfall over a large catchment. It is selected to demonstrate how to set up a simulation based on spatially- and temporally-varying rainfall data. The use of a post-processing toolkit for downscaling coarse-resolution DG2 flood maps is also explained.
