#### Eden 2015, fluvial flooding

This test case aims to simulate fluvial flooding resulted from rainfall over a large catchment. It is selected to demonstrate how to set up a simulation based on spatially- and temporally-varying rainfall data. The use of a post-processing toolkit for downscaling coarse-resolution DG2 flood maps is also explained. 

The LISFLOOD-FP is applied to reproduce the flood event caused by the 2015 Storm Desmond, which brought heavy rainfall to the 2500 square kilometers Eden Catchment. Figure below shows a map of the Eden catchment [(Xia et al. 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030917081930243X). There are four major rivers in the catchment, including River Eden and its three tributaries, i.e. River Irthing, River Petteril and River Caldew. River Eden merges with the three tributaries as it passes through Carlisle, whiach was the most flooded city during the Storm Desmond event.
