#### Viewing the DEM data on QGIS

The original DEM data for the Merewether test case is available at a resolution of 0.01 m x 0.01 m in an [Esri ASCII raster file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm), named `merewether-0p01m.dem`. The DEM file can be loaded and viewed in QGIS following these steps:

- Open QGIS
- Go to menu *Layer - > Add Layer - > Add Raster Layer…* and browse for `merewether-0p1m.dem`
- Click *Add*, and the raster map would be shown as below:

- By right-clicking on the layer’s name and selecting *Properties - > Symbology* , the render type can be changed for a proper representation. Choosing *Singleband pseudocolor* results in the map below:
