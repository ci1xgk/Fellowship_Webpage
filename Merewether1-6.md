#### Start file â€“ water depth, water elevation, discharge (`.start`, `.start.Qx`, `.start.Qy`)

By default, LISFLOOD starts the simulations from zero depth and discharge initial condition on the domain. However, it is possible to have user defined initial condition for water depth (or elevation) and discharge. 

- Water depth or elevation

  This file is used to set the initial conditions of the model either as water depth or water elevation. It must be an [Esri ASCII raster file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) with the same dimension and resolution (i.e. `ncols`, `nrows`, `xllcorner`, `yllcorner`, `cellsize`) of the DEM file, followed by space delimited 2D array of water depth or water elevation values. To use the initial condition as water depth or water elevation, the keywords `startfile` or `startelev` must be included in `.par` file, respectively, followed by the name of the `.start` file to be read. An example of how to prepare `.start` file using QGIS is demonstrated for the Merewether case study in [_"Preparing the input data"_](/Merewether1-2.md).
