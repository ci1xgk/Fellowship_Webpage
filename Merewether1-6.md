#### Start file â€“ water depth (or free-surface elevation) and discharges (`.start`, `.start.Qx`, `.start.Qy`)

By default, LISFLOOD-FP starts the simulations from a zero water depth and zero discharge initial conditions. However, the default initial conditions can be overwritten by user-defined initial water depth (or free-surface elevation) map and/or discharges map.

* **Water depth (or free-surface elevation) initialisation.** With this option, a zero discharge initial condition is retained. Depending on the item entered in the `.par` file, LISFLOOD-FP is expected to read an initial condition of a water depth or a free-surface elevation from a `.start` file. The `.start` file must be an [Esri ASCII raster file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) with the same dimension and resolution (i.e. `ncols`, `nrows`, `xllcorner`, `yllcorner`, `cellsize`) of the DEM file, followed by a space-delimited 2D array of water depth or free-surface elevation values in metre. To use the initial condition as water depth or free-surface elevation, the items startfile or startelev must be included in the `.par` file, respectively, followed by the name of the `.start` file to be read. An example of how to prepare a `.start` file using QGIS is demonstrated for the Merewether case study in [_"Preparing the input data"_](/Merewether2.md). 

* **Water depth (or free-surface elevation) and discharge initialisation.** With this option, LISFLOOD-FP is expected to read the initial condition of either a water depth or a free-surface elevation from a `.start` file, as well as the initial condition of unit-width discharges from `.start.Qx` and `.start.Qy` files. The `.start.Qx` and `.start.Qy` files must contain the initial conditions of X- and Y- components of the unit-width discharge fields, qx and qy (qx = Qx/h, qy=Qy/h). They must be an [Esri ASCII raster file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) with the same dimension and resolution (i.e. `ncols`, `nrows`, `xllcorner`, `yllcorner`, `cellsize`) of the DEM file, followed by a space-delimited 2D array of qx or qy values, in square metre per second. These two files must have the same name as the `.start` file, while adding the extensions `.Qx` and `.Qy` after the `.start` extension (i.e. `.start.Qx` and `.start.Qy`). To activate this option, after activating the water depth (or free-surface elevation) initialisation, as explained above, the user only needs to include the item `startq2d` in the `.par` file.
