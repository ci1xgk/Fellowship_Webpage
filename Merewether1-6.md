#### Start file â€“ water depth (or elevation) and discharge (`.start`, `.start.Qx`, `.start.Qy`)

By default, LISFLOOD starts the simulations from zero water depth and zero discharge initial conditions. However, it is possible to have user-defined initial condition for water depth (or elevation) and discharge. 

* **Water depth (or elevation) initialisation.** In this option, a zero discharge initial condition is retained. Depending on the keyword entered in the `.par` file, LISFLOOD is expected to read an initial condition of a water depth or a free-surface elevation from a `.start` file. The `.start` file must be an [Esri ASCII raster file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) with the same dimension and resolution (i.e. `ncols`, `nrows`, `xllcorner`, `yllcorner`, `cellsize`) of the DEM file, followed by space delimited 2D array of water depth or free-surface elevation values in meter. To use the initial condition as water depth or free-surface elevation, the keywords `startfile` or `startelev` must be included in `.par` file, respectively, followed by the name of the `.start` file to be read. An example of how to prepare `.start` file using QGIS is demonstrated for the Merewether case study in [_"Preparing the input data"_](/Merewether2.md). 

* **Water depth (or elevation) and discharge initialisation.** In this option, LISFLOOD is expected to read the initial condition of either a water depth or a free-surface elevation from a `.start` file, and the initial condition of unit-width discharges from `.start.Qx` and `.start.Qy` files. The `.start.Qx` and `.start.Qy` files must contain the initial conditions of X- and Y- components of the unit-width discharge fields, qx and qy (qx = Qx/h, qy=Qy/h). They must be an [Esri ASCII raster file](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/esri-ascii-raster-format.htm) with the same dimension and resolution (i.e. `ncols`, `nrows`, `xllcorner`, `yllcorner`, `cellsize`) of the DEM file, followed by space delimited 2D array of qx or qy values, in square meter per second. These two files must have the same name as the `.start` file, while `.Qx` and `.Qy` must be added at the end of the `.start` extension. To activate this option, after activating the **water depth (or elevation) initialisation**, as explained above, the user only needs to include the keyword `startq2d` in the `.par` file.
